# archlinux-pkgs-debloated 

*Previously known as 'llvm-libs-debloated'*

---

This repo makes modified versiones of Archlinux packages, these are intended for AppImages to reduce final size, like:

* `mesa-mini` and `vulkan-{radeon,intel,etc}-mini` remove linking to `libLLVM.so`, making any hardware accelerated app tiny as result.

* `mesa-nano` and `vulkan-{radeon,intel,etc}-nano` similar to `mesa-mini`, built with -Os which makes it ~30% smaller. Note -Os can have a performance and even stability issue so do not use this package in apps like emulators where this is critical.

* `llvm-libs-mini` smaller version of `libLLVM.so` which is a 150+ MiB library, this version is reduced down to 99 MiB. 

* `llvm-libs-nano` similar to mine but with the llvm targets limited (`x86_64` or `aarch64`) + `AMDGPU`, this reduces the size of the library to less than 70 MiB. Note this will cause issues if application dependso on more llvm targets

* `qt6-base-mini` and `libxml2-mini`, remove 30 MiB libicudata lib dependency.

* `ffmpeg-mini` which removes 20 MiB libx265.so dependency, also removes AV1 enconding support (decoding still works).

* `opus-mini` I have no idea why Archlinux makes this lib 5 MiB when both ubuntu and alpine make it <500 KiB
